Welcome to my page !

I am an Assistant Professor of the Department of Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences at Kyungpook National University.
Mainly focusing on the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
Especially the black hole accretion flow and jet physics through the high-resolution imaging / astrometry / polarimetry are major research subjects.
