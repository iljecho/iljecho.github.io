**I am a Radio Astronomer and Assistant Professor at Kyungpook National University.**

I use Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to study supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. My work focuses on jet physics and accretion flows using high-resolution imaging, astrometry, and polarimetry.
