I am radio astronomer, mainly focusing on the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
Especially the black hole accretion flow and jet physics through the high-resolution imaging / astrometry / polarimetry are major research subjects.
Regarding this, I have been actively working as a member of several large collaborations of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), next-generation EHT (ngEHT), East Asia VLBI Network (EAVN) AGN Science Working Group, RadioAstron AGN Science Working Group, and Multi-frequency AGN Survey with KVN (MASK) project.
Together with the vicinity of SMBHs, investigating the intermediate-mass black holes and the AGN feedback on its environments/host galaxy are in a scope of interest.

Besides the astrophysics, I am passionate about the software / pipeline developments that can be hopefully used in broader fields, as well as the astronomical data imaging and analysis. 

I have received Ph.D. in astrophysics at the University of Science and Technology ([UST](www.ust.ac.kr){:target="_blank"}, Daejeon, Korea) and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute ([KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index){:target="_blank"}) in 2021.
Currently I am working as postdoctoral researcher in the [VLBI Group](http://vlbigroup.iaa.es){:target="_blank"} at Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía ([IAA - CSIC](https://www.iaa.csic.es/){:target="_blank"}, Granada, Spain), together with Dr. José L. Gómez.
